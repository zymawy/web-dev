            <b>Introduction:</b> What is the essential story being told by your site and what type of structure did you
            choose
            to
            implement?

            <p>
                it's coder news, from developers to developers. sharing knowledge in such a high-demand industry as tech
                is a valuable thing to do. A substantial amount of understanding will also be gained by the developers
                through the teaching process.
            </p>
        </li>

            <b>Inspiration:</b> State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website (e.g. guest speakers,
            websites,
            artists, blogs).
            <p>
                Tech news is one of my favorite things. It is one of the best resources for me in order to gain more
                knowledge about the tech industry and gain valuable information.
                Firstly, I was inspired by laravel-news since I'm a team lead and should stay on top of the latest tech
                industry news. A second inspiration comes from a magazine dedicated to developers and designers. the
                smashingmagazine is considered an old and valuable one. Finally, Syrian Researchers collect the latest
                news for the tech industry on its local (Arabic language) news blog.
